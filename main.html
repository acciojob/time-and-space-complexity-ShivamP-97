	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	 <p>
        Time complexity is a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm changes 
		with the size of the input. It helps us analyze whether an algorithm is efficient 
		and suitable for large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in 
		relation to the input size. For example, an algorithm that requires memory proportional 
		to the input size has a space complexity of O(n).
